### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Markus and I am currently finishing my master's in Computer Science and Engineering at Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The master's thesis I am working on is about Ontology Matching. The project is written in F#. 
The repositories containing the project are private for now but will (hopefully) become public at a later time.

Other git profiles:

- Codeberg: <https://codeberg.org/markusbrammer>
- GitLab (DTU): <https://gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk/s183816>
